## Features

Added some very rudimentary features into this to have at least some dependencies and a bit of code to test.

- web server
- request data from OSM
- transform data to simplified JSON format

## CI steps

The CI setup will execute the following jobs

- code linting using standardjs
- unit tests using ava
- [ ] build a docker image
- [ ] codeclimate tests
